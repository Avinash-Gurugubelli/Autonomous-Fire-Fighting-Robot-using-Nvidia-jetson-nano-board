An autonomous fire fighting robot : Enchancing safety through automatic fire detection and supression using nvida jetson nano board
 In modern fire protection, a synergy of sensors detects fires swiftly, triggering alarms for prompt evacuation. 
Suppression methods like sprinklers combat fires effectively, alongside centralized control panels for real-time 
monitoring. Emergency communication tools aid coordination, ensuring a comprehensive, rapid response to safeguard 
lives and property from fire's devastation. Fire extinguisher robots, employing advanced sensors and firefighting 
mechanisms, autonomously combat fires in hazardous environments. The algorithms we are using in proposed system 
is Haar cascade Algorithm,VGG16. Advantages include risk reduction and rapid response, mitigating property 
damage. Challenges involve reliable detection, navigation in hazards, real-time decision-making, and power supply. 
Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for enhancing these robots' capabilities, prioritizing safety, and effectively 
combating fires
